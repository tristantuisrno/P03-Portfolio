            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Conducting a User Survey</h3><br>

            <p>To better understand the average consumer and their consumption habits, I conducted a <a
                    href="https://forms.gle/tQQy4S6fMsWU7Rd29" target="_blank">short survey</a> and shared it on
                Instagram and various
                survey-sharing subreddits such as r/SampleSize and r/TakeMySurvey. Participants answered questions
                pertaining to their clothing consumption habits and knowledge of
                sustainable fashion practices. <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15a2Zk4iMKTzGk7I5EnsNVQUoNAJEmTQueuuIYOVe3u8/edit?usp=sharing "
                    target="_blank">Click
                    here</a> to see the full survey results.<br><br>

                The survey reached 35 people, 70% between the ages of 16 to 25 and 30% between the ages of 26 and 44. I
                found that most users particularly value the size, fit, and price when purchasing a garment.
                90% of participants buy multiple clothes with similar characteristics to the ones they already
                own. Interestingly, some participants supported this by noting that doing so reduces the frequency of
                laundry loads. Others have also mentioned that they had forgotten they had already owned something
                similar.<br><br>

                The general outlook on sustainable fashion implies costly effort. Most people seem aware of
                sustainable choices such as eco-friendly materials, fair labour wages, and buying secondhand.
                However, an overlooked aspect of the sustainable fashion was reusing garments they already own.

            <h2>Framing the Solution</h2>
            <h3>Problem (Why)</h3><br>
            <p>Based on the survey, it seems as if most people are aware of making sustainable fashion efforts through
                educating themselves on the garments and how they were made, supporting sustainable brands, and opting
                to buy secondhand. <b>Although these options are great in theory, they still promote buying and
                    consuming
                    more.</b></p><br>


            <h3>Opportunity (What)</h3><br>
            <p>By using <a href="https://tristanturisno.wixsite.com/portfolio/gridrack#user-personas"
                    target="_blank">user personas</a> to frame this issue, there is a unique opportunity to create a
                virtual wardrobe
                experience, promoting the reuse of garments users already own and decluttering unneeded items.</p><br>


            <h3>Solution (How)</h3><br>
            <p>After <a href="https://tristanturisno.wixsite.com/portfolio/gridrack#competitive-analysis"
                    target="_blank">analyzing market gaps</a> in competing closet-tracking applications, I propose to
                create a visual, community-driven, interactive experience. Key features to note are having a
                gender-neutral UI, custom closet article limiting, and a Pintrest-esque fashion community to drive
                inspiration.</p><br>

            <h2>The Design</h2>
            <h3>Onboarding Process</h3><br>

            <p>Mobile onboarding is a critical step in introducing users to a new application. Here, users are able to
                personalize their content based on clothing preferences and styles. This information will be used to
                give the user a baseline of the content recommended to them later in the application.</p>

        <div class="column-paragraph-lone ">
            <h3>Home Page & User Profile</h3><br>

            <p>The home page begins with the user's own outfits to support the idea of reusing one's own garments as
                "sustainable fashion." In addition, the user's following feed follows a two-column structure rather than
                one column to draw less attention to the other user's outfit, but rather as a thumbnail to quickly view
                as inspiration. </p>

        <div class="column-paragraph-lone ">
            <h3>User Closet</h3><br>

            <p>Users are able to customize their closets to their preferences with options to add and reconfigure the
                order of their closet categories (ie. tops, bottoms, and shoes) and specify a numerical limit to these
                categories.</p>

            <h3>Add New Items (via Camera & Search) & New Outfits</h3><br>

            <p>Tapping the plus icon in the navigation bar triggers an overlay with three options to appear: adding a
                new item via camera, search or adding a new outfit. This feature is highlighted and placed in the centre
                of the navigation bar to imply that this will be one of the application's primary user features. </p>

        <div class="column-paragraph-lone ">
            <h3>Explore & Search</h3><br>

            <p>Staying true to reusing the clothes one already has, the item and outfit cards in the explore and search
                pages include a section featuring items similar to ones already existing in the user's closet. </p>
