            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Conducting a User Survey</h3><br>

            <p>To better understand the average consumer and their consumption habits, I conducted a <a
                    href="https://forms.gle/tQQy4S6fMsWU7Rd29">short survey</a> and shared it on Instagram and various
                survey-sharing subreddits such as r/SampleSize and r/TakeMySurvey. Participants answered questions
                pertaining to their clothing consumption habits and knowledge of
                sustainable fashion practices. <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15a2Zk4iMKTzGk7I5EnsNVQUoNAJEmTQueuuIYOVe3u8/edit?usp=sharing">Click here</a>  to see the survey results.<br><br>

                The survey reached 35 people, 70% between the ages of 16 to 25 and 30% between the ages of 26 and 44. I
                found that most users particularly value the size, fit, and price when purchasing a garment.
                90% of participants buy multiple clothes with similar characteristics to the ones they already
                own. Interestingly, some participants supported this by noting that doing so reduces the frequency of
                laundry loads. Others have also mentioned that they had forgotten they had already owned something
                similar.<br><br>

                The general outlook on sustainable fashion implies costly effort. Most people seem aware of
                sustainable choices such as eco-friendly materials, fair labour wages, and buying secondhand.
                However, an overlooked aspect of the sustainable fashion was reusing garments they already own.
